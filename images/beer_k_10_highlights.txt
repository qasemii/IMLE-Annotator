well , it 's not really a \hlc[red!60]{kriek} , and not really a flander 's red either -- somewhere in between . the beer base is a stanard sour belgian beer with tart berry notes , hints of vineous and woodiness and a hint of \hlc[red!60]{funk} . the body lacks the firm malt base for a \hlc[red!60]{flanders} , but not candy-sweet enough for a \hlc[red!60]{kriek} but does show subtle character of both . a mild malt base struggles to support the sourness and \hlc[red!60]{cherry} flavors but does keep the beer from \hlc[red!60]{complete} astringency and thinness . hops are light , but do show some american citrus notes which i find quite \hlc[red!60]{pleasant} . somewhat lemony and berry-like to go along with the added \hlc[red!60]{fruits} . still a \hlc[red!60]{fine} beer that i enjoyed quite well , but it does \hlc[red!60]{n't} represent styles well -- let 's just call it a belgian sour beer with cherries added . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.72 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.7\\

i was shocked to find such a \hlc[red!60]{wonderful} beer in a town where the \hlc[red!60]{macros} seem to advertise everywhere ; i was surprised that i did not see a neon sign on the high school . but this is one killer beer and made me come back to the firehouse for 3 straight days . \hlc[cyan!30]{it pours a }\hlc[purple!30]{deep}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{dark}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{brown}\hlc[cyan!30]{ with a }\hlc[purple!30]{slim}\hlc[cyan!30]{ head , but it produced such }\hlc[purple!30]{beautiful}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{lacing}\hlc[cyan!30]{ you just can not fault it .} the aroma reminded me of a nice think hunk of dark bread dunked in a nice mellow bourbon . having this on the sampler woke me up as everything else while decent , had little character . but once i had it once i could see no reason to order anything else . the flavor was extremely malty with a subtle hoppiness , but the big alcohol punch it packed was what stood up to be noticed . unlike some high alcohol beers this was perfect in flavor and even though you could tell that it was strong , i felt that i needed to drink as many as i could . overall , a damn \hlc[red!60]{nice} beer that i could really only compare to heavyweight 's purkuno 's hammer , but this might be a little more think and \hlc[red!60]{luscious} , hard to believe as that is . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.92 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.9\\

i slammed this beer before . i think that has alot to do with \hlc[red!60]{freshness} , as i think this is a \hlc[red!60]{solid} , tasty everyday beer that does \hlc[red!60]{n't} always get what it \hlc[red!60]{deserves} . \hlc[red!60]{fruity} , cascade-packed , then sort of \hlc[red!60]{thin} and floating away in the mouthfeel but \hlc[red!60]{addicting} , this beer is a museum of the first wave of ipa 's . i think this one still stands up , especially when considered to other examples that just seem sort of \hlc[red!60]{boring} these days ( however valid that sentiment is ) . try it if you have \hlc[red!60]{n't} . and throw a six of the \hlc[red!60]{fresh} stuff in the fridge if you have and show your uneducated beer friends that ipa 's can be simple and not palate assaulting . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.61 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

\hlc[red!60]{stately} , mature , characterful and slight eccentric- this is belgian brewing at its best ! with less tartness than flemish reds or \hlc[red!60]{lambics} but with a \hlc[red!60]{rich} \hlc[red!60]{depth} of character that distinguishes it from the typical \hlc[red!60]{belgian} doubles and triples . understated yet \hlc[red!60]{creamy} carbonation allows for a mellow decanting- nearly \hlc[red!60]{cask-like} . distinct aromas ar of must , peaty earth , lightly horsey and with a cork-like wodiness . rich malt flavors push to the forefront , but foregoing the associates sweetness of caramel or sugar . medium bodied in \hlc[red!60]{texture} , the mild lemony sourness seems to further lighten the \hlc[red!60]{malt-forward} ale and usher in a soft lactic dryness . mildly astringent when the woody notes pronounce , but the finish is a \hlc[red!60]{marvelous} malty-dry yet crisply tart combination that work in harmony a light earthy/briney flavor reminds me orval except with more body and sweetness . riding on the side saddle with french ales but with the sour attitue of the senne valley the beer is a new adventure with each sip . masculine and refines but without pretention . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.77 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

i was in new zealand for an entire month , and on arrival i was quite looking forward to the \hlc[red!60]{beers} of a former british holding . i was sorely disappointed almost the entire time i was there -- most beers tended to be sweet , \hlc[red!60]{thick} , and malty like american malt liquor without the high abv that justifies them . until i met sassy red ... \hlc[cyan!30]{a : actually , sassy red is }\hlc[purple!30]{n't}\hlc[cyan!30]{ all that red , sort of }\hlc[purple!30]{amber}\hlc[cyan!30]{ with a }\hlc[purple!30]{suntan}\hlc[cyan!30]{ .} s : the smell is the best part -- it 's biscuity and toasty with some nut oil -- brazil nut and \hlc[red!60]{almond} - in there , all carried out with popping hoppiness right on the front of the \hlc[red!60]{nose} . t : unlike most amber/reds with toasty notes in the \hlc[red!60]{nose} , sassy red actually carried those \hlc[red!60]{comforting} flavors in to the taste . the only reason that this rating does n't exceed a four is because the beer is marketed as a bitter , but in fact its not as bitter as it might be . it is more hoppy than bitter -- more vegetal than a bitter might normally express . m : thinner than it could be , and carries just a little too much carbonation for its type of \hlc[red!60]{flavor} , but still very pleasant and slick . d : it must be drinkable -- i had about 8 in the auckland airport while my flight was delayed . this is a beer i want as my first and my last of the night -- something i can say about few others . it is flavorful enough to get me going and keep me interested , but not in any way cloying or too heavy . i already miss sassy red and i just got back . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.70 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

i hate to be the guy who disses a top rated brew , but i guess today i am that guy . maybe i 'm just sick of beers like this , but i feel like once you 've had one double-imperial-chocolate-coffee-espresso-mocha-java-extravaganza stout you 've had 'em all . the coffee and chocolate flavors are too much for beer , or too at least too much for this beer . i love a nice stout that has a more subtle coffee or \hlc[red!60]{chocolaty} flavor that 's imparted by the kind of malt they used , but this straight up infused flavor is too syrupy for me in general . do n't get me wrong , it is \hlc[red!60]{delicious} , it 's just not something i like in my beer i 've decided \hlc[cyan!30]{appears a }\hlc[purple!30]{dark}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{pitch}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{brown}\hlc[cyan!30]{ color , a }\hlc[purple!30]{wimpy}\hlc[cyan!30]{ head that }\hlc[purple!30]{dissapears}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{quickly}\hlc[cyan!30]{ .} smells extremely roasty and sweet , but with a ton of nice bitterness in the form of coffee and bitter chocolate . maybe even from the hops but i ca n't really detect any . taste could be full of complex flavors , and the potential is there , but the palate is really overrun with the intense coffee bean chocolate party that 's going on in this beer . i 've already talked about that part ... the real saving grace of this beer is the mouthfeel . soft and \hlc[red!60]{pillowy} , it 's so smooth and just velvety on the palate with a slight chewyness . if i had no tastebuds even i would drink this just for the \hlc[red!60]{texture} . to finish up , it could just be me or a stylistic sort of preference thing , but the strong coffee flavors do n't work for this beer i hate to say . check out the black rye from founders , there 's a killer beer for ya . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.59 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.7\\

my opinion is unfortunately tainted because of my love for all things bitter . with that said , i do n't know why there are a certain few that ca \hlc[red!60]{n't} stand this beer . i would think it could harbor a \hlc[red!60]{mediocre} review on style compatibility alone- this is an \hlc[red!60]{apa} and tastes/drinks as such . i , of \hlc[red!60]{course} , think that it 's the best thing in a can that is out there , and one of my favorite hoppy brews overall . if you like hops , then this will double the size of \hlc[red!60]{your} \hlc[red!60]{hop} head . sure it 's \hlc[red!60]{unbalanced} , but that is the \hlc[red!60]{appeal} of the apa- an overhopped ipa . am i right ? and to validate my opinion , i had this beer on a non-hyped recomendation of a liquor store owner on my visit to the carolina's- i 'd never even heard of it before then . so , hyped or not , from a one hop lover to the \hlc[red!60]{next} , buy a six and \hlc[red!60]{enjoy} . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.62 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

this beer tastes like \hlc[red!60]{vomit} . no really , it actually tastes and smells like fresh \hlc[red!60]{vomit} . that might sound rather harsh , but it 's the \hlc[red!60]{truth} . i struggled through one of these , \hlc[red!60]{hoping} at some point my palet would adjust to something that i was \hlc[red!60]{missing} , but \hlc[red!60]{no} , it just kept tasting like actual \hlc[red!60]{vomit} . i do \hlc[red!60]{n't} really know what else to say , when a beer tastes this terrible the appearance and \hlc[red!60]{texture} do \hlc[red!60]{n't} really matter . epic failure . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.31 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.4\\

beer review from ba mag aug 2007 . released in 2002 , this was apparently australia 's first 100 percent certified organic beer and boasts that it is 'generously hopped .

this beer is and was \hlc[red!60]{amazing} \hlc[red!60]{.} i have never tasted a beer that was this \hlc[red!60]{fruitful} . usually a beer does \hlc[red!60]{n't} have a flavor that is this \hlc[red!60]{pronounced} . the only way that i can relate this beer is to think of it as \hlc[red!60]{maraschino} \hlc[red!60]{cherries} . the beer also does not have a major \hlc[red!60]{aftertaste} . but the aftertaste it does have is \hlc[red!60]{much} like the \hlc[red!60]{overall} taste . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.69 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

so maybe waiting to try my first ten fidy on te hottest day of the year in massachusetts was \hlc[red!60]{n't} the best way to experience this beer . that being said , if this beer is as good in the dead of \hlc[red!60]{winter} as it was \hlc[red!60]{tonight} , that means something . \hlc[cyan!30]{it }\hlc[purple!30]{pours}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{black}\hlc[cyan!30]{ , with a }\hlc[purple!30]{chocolate}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{head}\hlc[cyan!30]{ .} \hlc[red!60]{malty} , bitter , chocolate smell . not overpowering but \hlc[red!60]{impressive} . nicely \hlc[red!60]{balanced} beer that definitely lives up to the hype still ca n't believe this beer comes out of a can , i will be picking more up soon . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.84 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.9\\

this is the common generally available 'bitter ' beer on hand pull in many pubs in my home town area in uk . unfortunately since coors took over the bass brewery some years \hlc[red!60]{ago} , the beer has changed its character somewhat to how it tasted 10 years ago . it can also be very variable in \hlc[red!60]{quality} , and i am not sure if this is due to the way it is kept by the pub staff , or the \hlc[red!60]{fault} of the \hlc[red!60]{brewery} . when in good condition ( and the best way to have it is straight from the barrel by gravity feed and \hlc[red!60]{no} head , though thats rare to see ! \hlc[cyan!30]{) it is a medium }\hlc[purple!30]{dark}\hlc[cyan!30]{ colour ( for a 'pale ' ale ) rich and }\hlc[purple!30]{inviting}\hlc[cyan!30]{ , with a more maltly aroma , but also a bit sulphury from the 'burton water ' that characterises this style and origin of the }\hlc[purple!30]{beer}\hlc[cyan!30]{ .} the taste is smooth and \hlc[red!60]{malty} , the hoppy bitterness well in the background , also hints of spicyness . over the last few years it seems to be less flavourful , the general malty smooth taste can remain , but less depth of flavour and character , and sometimes a bit sour and appears to be 'off ' in recent tastings of the beer , on more than one occasion we have had to take the beer back because it was obviously going off . this is a great \hlc[red!60]{shame} , as it was a great traditional british beer with lots of character and easy to drink . i have rated it disregarding the 'off ' samples had recently b'ham uk \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.68 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

this is mac 's interpretation of an india pale ale . i 'm more inclined to call it a uniquely-hopped pale ale , rather than an ipa , but who am i to argue with the brewer . let me explain . this beer , according to mccashin 's , is a 'late hopped pale ale . ' in practical terms -- at least to my nose/tongue -- that results in a very raw hoppiness . they use a combination of five different hops -- all grown in nelson , nz -- and they 're not added until the end of the \hlc[red!60]{boil} , which leaves a hoppy freshness right at the front of this beer . it 's almost as if the hops are not in this beer but on it . \hlc[cyan!30]{pours a }\hlc[purple!30]{dark}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{gold}\hlc[cyan!30]{ color with a }\hlc[purple!30]{slight}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{amber}\hlc[cyan!30]{ hue .} \hlc[cyan!30]{good }\hlc[purple!30]{,}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{sticky}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{head}\hlc[cyan!30]{ retention .} overall , this is a very \hlc[red!60]{unique} brew . how unique ? consider this : in 4.5 months of traveling in europe ( including belgium & germany ) then new zealand , this is the only one i felt compelled to take notes on ! if you 're ever down new zealand , skip the lion red and \hlc[red!60]{export} gold crap that floods the shelves and look for this beer . mac 's beers are made from 'all natural ingredients ' ( a phrase that actually has some meaning in new zealand ) . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.68 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.8\\

i picked this beer up on a whim as i was in the mood for a good \hlc[red!60]{coffee} stout and the siren-like figure somehow told me this is the beer for you . a bit freaky , but i went with it . \hlc[cyan!30]{i was impressed from the very first pour .} \hlc[cyan!30]{like any }\hlc[purple!30]{stout}\hlc[cyan!30]{ , the color is a dark }\hlc[purple!30]{molasses}\hlc[cyan!30]{ black .} \hlc[cyan!30]{but ... the head was }\hlc[purple!30]{thick}\hlc[cyan!30]{ and }\hlc[purple!30]{dense}\hlc[cyan!30]{ with }\hlc[purple!30]{good}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{retention}\hlc[cyan!30]{ .} the coffee aroma was intense ! the roasted goodness almost overwhelms my sense of smell . the roasted coffee flavors are the first things that i could taste along with hints of chocolate . however , i can tell there 's more complexity here than my palette can decipher . the coffee flavors bring bitterness but it 's not over powering as the sweetness of the malt cuts the bitterness quite nicely the beer has carbonation but once the bubbles have escaped the beer gives a \hlc[red!60]{creamy} , velvety feel and finish . the alcohol was very well hidden in this beer which is \hlc[red!60]{scary} . this is an \hlc[red!60]{amazing} coffee stout . it is a very drinkable beer as it does not leave your mouth feeling bitter and dry ; it only leaves it wanting more . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.91 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 1.0\\

octoberfest : say the word and you probably think of lederhosen , big parties with communal tables , beer girls dressed in traditional garb , and a brew like this . i sure did so when i saw this available via the single bottle , i figured that this would be a great brew to enjoy the season with , even if i could n't get to a real event like those in germany attend every year . like so many others on here , i was let down by this beer from the moment i poured it out . i know that marzens are n't the highest rated brews on here , but i do expect an imported offering like this to have some taste , body , and drinkability to it \hlc[cyan!30]{light pour to this was a }\hlc[purple!30]{good}\hlc[cyan!30]{ }\hlc[purple!30]{head}\hlc[cyan!30]{ and }\hlc[purple!30]{lacing}\hlc[cyan!30]{ that was better than expected .} those were the best aspects of this beer as the aroma was \hlc[red!60]{practically} \hlc[red!60]{nonexistent} and the \hlc[red!60]{head} \hlc[red!60]{faded} fairly quickly . marzen 's tend to be a bit thin in the mouthfeel for me but even this did \hlc[red!60]{n't} match up to my less-than-lofty expectations . there was \hlc[red!60]{straw} , grass , and floral notes to this beer but i could n't wonder how much of the taste had to do with the green bottle . sure enough , this tasted skunked as soon as i took a sip and because this had n't been on the shelf that long , i think that spoke more about the beer than the presentation of it . further tasting of this led me to wonder what style it was , since it reminded me of an \hlc[red!60]{adjunct} lager in every aspect . the filler seemed less than up to standards and the aftertaste was sour enough to beg for a chaser - any type that would alleviate the lingering and uneasy bitterness i have no idea how something this bad could be so strong in the alcohol department . this is not the kind of beer i would want to get drunk on and even though the carbonation did n't detract from the taste , this was n't something that i could down very quickly . maybe i 'm not up to snuff on my appreciation of this style but after seeing how low this was rated on here , i 'm thinking that this beer is about a big a letdown as they get . \textbf{Predicted Score}: 0.46 - \textbf{Ground Truth}: 0.7\\
